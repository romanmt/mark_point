# Testing Guidelines

## Coverage Requirements
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Implement integration tests for critical workflows
- Test all DETS operations thoroughly

## Test Categories
- Unit Tests: Test individual functions and modules
- Integration Tests: Test interactions between components
- Concurrency Tests: Verify proper handling of concurrent access
- Migration Tests: Validate data migration scenarios

## Testing Best Practices
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use proper test data fixtures
