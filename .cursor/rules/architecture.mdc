# Architecture Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Maintain simplicity and code maintainability
- Follow strict separation of concerns:
  - UI Layer (Phoenix LiveView)
  - Data Storage Layer (DETS)
  - Business Logic Layer
- Adhere to functional programming principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling

## Technical Stack
- Elixir programming language with Phoenix framework
- Phoenix LiveView for real-time, interactive UI components
- DETS (Disk Erlang Term Storage) for persistent data storage
- Notes stored as Erlang terms in DETS tables

## Data Management
- Implement robust backup and recovery mechanisms
- Handle concurrent note access with proper synchronization
- Ensure data integrity across all operations
- Prevent data loss through proper error handling and validation
