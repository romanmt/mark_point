# Implementation Guidelines

## Coding Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Document all modules, functions, and complex logic
- Follow Elixir community best practices and style guides
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Use appropriate error types and messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Handle edge cases explicitly

## Data Operations
- Validate all data before storage
- Implement proper DETS table management
- Handle data versioning and migrations
- Ensure atomic operations where necessary

## Code Organization
- Group related functionality into cohesive modules
- Use proper module hierarchy
- Keep business logic separate from UI components
- Implement clear interfaces between layers
